In this section, we'll cover the software needed for creating a website.

The first and main ingredients are a text editor for writing your HTML and CSS and a browser for viewing the results.

Once you start searching the internet for help on your coding issues, you might read about all kinds of other tools, first and foremost the Terminal or Shell or many kinds of extensions for the editors for complex website setups. This can sometimes be intimidating to read. We encourage you to not get discouraged. An editor and a browser is totally sufficient and will get you a long way.

## The editor
Writing HTML and CSS requires a text editor. Text (or code) editors differ from software like LibreOffice, MS Word or TextEdit in the fact, that they save files as plain text, without adding any meta information to the file. This is important for the browsers to correctly display your HTML and CSS.

### Common editors for web development
There's quite a variety of editors out there. Our recommendations here focus on editors that make our lives as web developers easier and are commonly used by folks in the community.

The links below are mostly for future reference. For now, you can go straight ahead and install one of the editors below. If you have no idea which to choose, feel free to use Atom. You can always try out other editors later.

## The browser
In general, you can use any browser you prefer or use in your day-to-day life.

That said, we encourage you to use a so-called modern browser, such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/){:target="_blank"}, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}, [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge){:target="_blank"} or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/){:target="_blank"}. They come with a good support for newer CSS features.

Later on, especially when you publish a website, you will have to use all kinds of browsers to test your website. But for now, we want to help you focus on learning HTML and CSS and not get used to a new browser.

### The developer tools
Every browser has extra functionality to display the code of a website: the developer tools, also known as the DevTools.

This is a bit more advanced and might not make much sense to you right now. But during the CSSclasses day, you'll soon get to know them as a tool to find errors and to see what's going on when the displayed result is not what you expected.

Wanna have a look a the dev tools? If you go to our website [https://cssclass.es/](https://cssclass.es/){:target="_blank"} and right-click anywhere on the page, you will see the menu item "Inspect" or "Inspect element". Click it and the developer tools will open up.

Below are screenshots from Chrome and Firefox. Edge and Safari look very similar.
